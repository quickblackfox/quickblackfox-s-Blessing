So this is a mod. It adds some cool items I guess, have fun. This is very WIP, so don't be surprised if some things are unbalanced or unfinished. Some items are currently unobtainable without Cheat Sheet, HERO's, etc, so use a mod like that if you want to have everything.
This is mainly a passion project, but I will be adding more content (much more if I put a lot of time into it).

Currently all that is in the mod are an armour set, some swords, a bow, and some materials. There's also some ore that generates in the world, so that's pretty cool I guess.

Have fun??
